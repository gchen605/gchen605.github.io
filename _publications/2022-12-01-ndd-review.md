excerpt: 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) encompass a broad spectrum of disorders, linked because of their origins in brain developmental processes, including diverse conditions across the age span, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Clinical treatment of these disorders has traditionally focused on symptom management, as the severity of developmental disruption varies widely and the precise molecular mechanisms, timing, and progression of these disorders is usually not known.'
