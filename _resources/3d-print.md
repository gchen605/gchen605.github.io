## What is 3D printing? 
3D printing is an automated additive manufacturing process. There are numerous technologies for 3D printing, but for the purposes of this guide, we will ficus on the most commonly used one, called FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) in which an object is created layer by layer by melting a strand of plastic.

## What printer do we have?
We currently have a [Prusa Core One](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-core-one/)

# Basic workflow
* AKA I found something online I want to print *
There are 3 main steps to 3D printing:
1. Get a printable 3D model: Usually an STL or OBJ file, these are widely shared online
2. Prepare the file for printing: Using a 'slicer' software package, prepare the model file for printing. The slicer exports a 'G-code,' which is a printer-specific set of instructions that include information about temperature, output speed, etc.
3. Print it
