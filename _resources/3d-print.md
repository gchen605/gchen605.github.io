This is a short primer on getting started with 3D printing for the laboratory.

# Sections

1.  Definitions
2.  Basic workflow (aka: I found something online I want to print)
3.  Advanced workflow (aka: I want to design my own stuff to print)

## What is 3D printing? 
3D printing is an automated additive manufacturing process. There are numerous technologies for 3D printing, but for the purposes of this guide, we will ficus on the most commonly used one, called FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) in which an object is created layer by layer by melting a strand of plastic.

## What printer do we have?
We currently have a Prusa Core One (https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-core-one/)

## What can we print?

## What types of materials can we print?

## Aren't headings cool?
